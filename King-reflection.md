###Reflection After GPS 1.1

Going through the Guided Pairing was really interesting. I feel lucky to have been partnered with Sabri. It was my first time pairing at all, besides being my first guided session.  It was exciting and I think having a pair and a guide there really kept me on task. Though we went for about an hour and fifteen minutes, I felt like I could've gone longer with a team member working with me. It was energizing! 

I asked many questions to my pair and guide. What I knew the least about was the markdown language. Our guide helped us with a link to some syntax for that and my guide walked me through different elements of it. 

I conceptually understood git before the challenge but I think Sabri had an even better grasp on it than me. There was nothing specific that was particularly troubling. Though I did learn some shortcuts, like using "co" instead of "checkout" and using the tab button in the command line. 

There's nothing specifically about git that confuses me though I know there's certainly more levels I could delve into that I'm not yet using.

Overall I enjoyed pairing more than I thought I would.  I'm excited to do it more as I move through the DBC process.
