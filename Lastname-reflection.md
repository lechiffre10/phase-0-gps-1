##What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was comfortable with the flow before the GPS, but the GPS allowed me to put the collaboration into practice and cemented certain concepts. It felt refreshing to practice what was learned in an actual collaborative environment. 
##What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The concepts that were clarified were the merging of the feature-branch, the reasoning behind it, merge and pull requests. The overall git workflow seems less strenuous now practicing it with someone else.
##What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
The questions were more clarification than anything on certain commands on the terminal. The guide showed us certain best practices that save time and effort and we just reinforced that throughout the guided pairing session.
##What still confuses you about git?
My overall understanding is a lot better after this session. I'd like to get a bit more practice going through the steps again with future projects and solidifying everything. But i'm pretty comfortable using it now. Also, reviewing conflicts helps avoid them as well so it's great to have reviewed that.
##How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was excellent! My pair and I got along well, we had an open ended conversation and always looked to help each other out with tips or anything constructive. I love the approach to this education and Its benefits are already visible.
